# Section-by-Section Build Plan & Prompts

Use these prompts to guide the build for each section. Copy/paste or modify them as we proceed.

## Phase 1: Hero Section (The "Abyssal Void")
**Goal**: Create a deep, dark, immersive entry point.
**Prompt**:
> "Build the **Hero Section**.
> - **Logic**: Use a full-screen R3F Canvas with a custom shader or particle system (`HeroBackground.tsx`) that creates a slow, deep, underwater/space void effect. It should react subtly to mouse movement.
> - **Design**: Overlay a massive, centered title 'ARCTIC ZERO' (`HeroTitle.tsx`) using a bold font (Inter/Syne). The text should have a magnetic effect or a 'reveal' animation.
> - **Colors**: Deepest blacks (`#050505`), faint glowing purples/blues (`#4f46e5`)."

## Phase 2: About Section (The "Glass Persona")
**Goal**: A clean, readable introduction.
**Prompt**:
> "Build the **About Section**.
> - **Logic**: Create a layout that enters from the bottom as the user scrolls. Use a glassmorphism card effect (`AboutCard.tsx`).
> - **Design**: Split layout. Left side: 'Who I am' text. Right side: A 3D interactive object (e.g., a floating crystal or abstract shape).
> - **Animation**: Staggered text reveal. The 3D object should rotate based on scroll position."

## Phase 3: Work Section (The "Holographic Gallery")
**Goal**: Showcase projects with high interactivity.
**Prompt**:
> "Build the **Work Section**.
> - **Logic**: A horizontal scroll or grid gallery ([ProjectGallery.tsx](file:///e:/portfolio-test-one/src/components/dom/ProjectGallery.tsx)).
> - **Design**: Each project is a 'holographic' card. On hover, the card distorts (glitch effect) or expands.
> - **Interaction**: Clicking a card opens a detailed modal or navigates to a case study with a smooth transition."

## Phase 4: Contact Section (The "Signal")
**Goal**: Simple, impactful footer.
**Prompt**:
> "Build the **Contact Section**.
> - **Logic**: A footer that reveals itself at the very bottom.
> - **Design**: Giant typography 'SAY HELLO' that links to email.
> - **Vibe**: Minimalist. The background particles from the Hero section should act 'excited' or faster here."
